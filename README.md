This is going to be a butter robot :). This project is accosiated with the course TTK4851, "Robots and Humans" at NTNU.

##Idea
We want this to be your new robot friend that may assist you whenever you are in need of butter. The robot should be able to avoid different kinds of obstacles that may be found on a breakfast table and deliver the butter safely to you safely, but only if you use the magic word.
